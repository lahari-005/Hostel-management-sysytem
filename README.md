# Hostel-management-sysytem
This SQL script creates and manages a Hostel Management System (hstlms) database that organizes resident information along with their guardians, rent payments, room allocations, and work details. The schema includes tables for Resident (storing personal details such as name, age, gender, contact, and email), Guardian (holding guardian details and relation), Rent (tracking payment plans, amounts, dates, and modes), Room (assigning residents to rooms, floors, and blocks), and Work (capturing employment or student status along with company details). Additionally, multiple views such as ResidentDetails, GuardianContacts, RentSummary, OccupiedRooms, and WorkDetails are created to simplify access to frequently used combined data, ensuring efficient hostel data management.
